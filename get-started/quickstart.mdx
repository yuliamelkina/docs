## Overview

This quickstart guide will walk you through the basic setup and your first API calls with Omniwire. By the end, you'll have created a customer, set up a wallet, and understand the core workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Ability to make HTTP requests (curl, Postman, or your preferred tool)
- Your API credentials (Api-Key and X-Api-Key)

## Step 1: Test Your Connection

First, verify you can connect to the API:

```bash
curl -X GET https://staging.omniwire.com/ping \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

If successful, you should receive a 200 OK response confirming the API is accessible.

## Step 2: Create Your First Customer

Create an individual customer with basic information:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://staging.omniwire.com/customers \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "individual",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe", 
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "birth_date": "1990-01-01",
    "residential_address": {
      "street_line_1": "123 Main Street",
      "city": "Portland",
      "subdivision": "US-ME",
      "postal_code": "04101",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "identifying_information": [
      {
        "type": "ssn",
        "issuing_country": "USA", 
        "number": "123-45-6789"
      }
    ],
    "endorsements": ["base"],
    "signed_agreement_id": "agr_test_abc123xyz"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "cust_1234567890abcdef",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "has_accepted_terms_of_service": true,
  "endorsements": [
    {
      "name": "base",
      "status": "approved"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Create a Custodial Wallet

Now create a Solana wallet for your customer:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://staging.omniwire.com/customers/cust_1234567890abcdef/wallets \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chain": "solana"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "wallet_abcdef1234567890",
  "chain": "solana", 
  "address": "SolanaAddress1111111111111111111111111111111",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z",
  "balances": [
    {
      "balance": "0.0",
      "currency": "SOL",
      "chain": "solana"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Account (Optional)

Create a virtual account to receive ACH deposits that automatically convert to USDC:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staging.omniwire.com/customers/cust_1234567890abcdef/virtual_accounts \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "currency": "usd"
    },
    "destination": {
      "payment_rail": "solana",
      "currency": "usdc", 
      "address": "SolanaAddress1111111111111111111111111111111"
    },
    "developer_fee_percent": "0.5"
  }'
```

## Step 5: Check Customer Status

Verify your customer and check their KYC status:

```bash
curl -X GET https://staging.omniwire.com/customers/cust_1234567890abcdef \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key"
```

## Development Tips

### Idempotency Keys
Always use idempotency keys for create operations:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staging.omniwire.com/customers \
  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-usage-key" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```
