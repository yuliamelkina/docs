  -H "Api-Key: test-api-key" \
  -H "Tenant-Id: your-tenant-uuid" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newemail@example.com",
    "residential_address": {
      "street_line_1": "456 New Street",
      "city": "Portland",

  -H "Tenant-Id: your-tenant-uuid" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \

## Data Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- All PII is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access is logged and monitored
- Data retention follows regulatory requirements
- GDPR and CCPA compliance for applicable customers

### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary information
- Delete data when no longer required
- Anonymize data for analytics
- Provide data export capabilities

## Integration Patterns

### Customer Onboarding Flow

```javascript
// 1. Create customer
const customer = await createCustomer({
  type: 'individual',
  first_name: 'John',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  // ... other required fields
});

// 2. Check status and requirements
const customerStatus = await getCustomer(customer.id);
console.log('Status:', customerStatus.status);
console.log('Requirements:', customerStatus.requirements_due);

// 3. Handle requirements fulfillment
if (customerStatus.requirements_due.includes('identity_verification')) {
  // Guide user through ID verification
  await initiateIDVerification(customer.id);
}

// 4. Wait for approval
while (customerStatus.status !== 'active') {
  await delay(5000);
  customerStatus = await getCustomer(customer.id);
}

// 5. Customer is ready to use platform
console.log('Customer activated:', customer.id);
```

### Status Monitoring

```javascript
function handleCustomerStatus(customer) {
  switch (customer.status) {
    case 'active':
      enableFullPlatformAccess(customer.id);
      break;
    case 'under_review':
      showReviewMessage(customer.id);
      break;
    case 'awaiting_questionnaire':
      redirectToQuestionnaire(customer.id);
      break;
    case 'incomplete':
      showRequirements(customer.requirements_due);
      break;
    case 'rejected':
      handleRejection(customer.rejection_reasons);
      break;
    default:
      showGenericWaitingMessage();
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
